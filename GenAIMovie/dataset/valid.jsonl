CARPET sees ABU and grabs his tail trying in vain to hold him back.  ALADDIN finally reaches the MAGIC LAMP.) ALADDIN:    This is it?  This is what we came all the way down here to--  (He looks down and sees ABU break free of CARPET's hold and lunge toward the jewel.)  Abu- NO! (ABU grabs the jewel.  There is a rumbling and the room begins to shake.) CAVE VOICE: Infidels! ABU:            Uh oh! CAVE VOICE: You have touched the forbidden treasure.  (ABU places the jewel back into the paw, but the jewel and the shrine melt into lava.) Now you will never again see the light of day! (ALADDIN races down the steps, but they flatten into a ramp, and he skies down until he flies into the air.  The water has turned into lava.  He is falling toward it, when all of a sudden CARPET appears and catches him.   ABU is standing on one of the rocks of the bridge. He looks left and right and sees rocks exploding into lava. Then CARPET races over and ALADDIN grabs him, just as the last rock is exploding.) ALADDIN:    Whoa!  Carpet, let's move! (Together, they race back through the caves dodging walls and falling debris.  ABU grabs ALADDIN's head and covers his eyes.) ALADDIN:    Abu, this is no time to panic!  (He pulls ABU off his head and sees they are flying into a wall.) Start panicking. (CARPET goes into a dive, then through another cave.  Finally, they emerge through the internal entrance.  Outside, the cave begins to growl and close.  CARPET and company are almost to the top when a boulder drops on carpet, sending it to the floor.  ALADDIN  grabs onto the rock wall and holds on.  He sees the OLD MAN at the top, within reach.) ALADDIN:    Help me out! OLD MAN:    Throw me the lamp! ALADDIN:    I can't hold on.  Give me your hand. OLD MAN:    First give me the lamp! (ALADDIN reaches in and pulls out the MAGIC LAMP.  He hands it up, a nd the OLD MAN raises it above his head.) OLD MAN:    Ha ha ha ha!  Yes!  At last!  Ha ha ha ha! (ALADDIN has climbed out with the assistance of ABU.  But the OLD MAN kicks aside ABU and grabs ALADDIN's wrist.) ALADDIN:    What are you doing? OLD MAN:    Giving you your reward.  (JAFAR returns to his normal voice.) Your eternal reward. (He pulls out a crooked dagger and is about to stab ALADDIN, when ABU bites him on the wrist.  He screams, but lets go of ALADDIN, who falls into the cave.  OLD MAN throws ABU into the cave as well.  They fall.  CARPET sees this, but is pinned under a boulder.  It struggles to break free, then does.  It races up and catches ALADDIN, but he has already hit the wall several times, and is unconscious.  On the surface, the cave roars one final time, then sinks back into the sand.  JAFAR pulls off his disguise.) JAFAR:  Heh heh heh! It's mine.  It's all mine! I (He can't find it in his pocket)--- where is it?  No. NO!! (Kiss fade to JASMINE's bedroom.  She is sitting on her bed, next to RAJAH who looks sad. The SULTAN walks in.) SULTAN: Jasmine?  Oh, dearest.  What's wrong? JASMINE:    Jafar...has...done something... terrible.  (She looks as if she's been crying.) SULTAN: There, there, there, my child--we'll set it right. Now, tell me everything. (Cut to int. of cave.  ALADDIN lies unconscious on the CARPET. ABU tries to wake him.) ABU:        Oh, oh. Aladdin?  Wake up.  Aladdin. ALADDIN:    Oh, my head. (He looks at the entrance sealed in.) We're trapped.  (Angry, shaking his fists at the entrance) That two faced son-of-a-jackal!  (Calmer) Whoever he was, he's long gone with that lamp. ABU:        Aha! ALADDIN:    Why, you hairy little thief!  Looks like such a beat-up, worthless piece of junk.  Hey, I think there's something written here, but it's hard to make out. (He rubs the LAMP.  Suddenly smoke comes out of the hole, the LAMP begins to shake and glow, but ALADDIN holds onto the LAMP, and our wonderful friend, the GENIE comes out.) GENIE:  Aaaaahhhhh!  OY!  Ten-thousand years will give ya such a crick in the neck!  (He hangs ALADDIN on a nearby rock.  Then he pulls his head off and spins it around, yelling as he does so.  CARPET pulls a ALADDIN down.)  Whoa!  Does it feel good to be outta there! (GENIE uses the lamp end of himself as a microphone.) Nice to be back, ladies and gentlemen.  Hi, where ya from? (Sticks the mic in ALADDIN's face.)  What's your name? ALADDIN:    Uh, Al--uh--Aladdin. GENIE:  (Says his name as if he's discovered something major) Aladdin! (A neon sign lights up with ALADDIN's name on it, circled by chase lights.  The sign changes to reflect the GENIE's upcoming line.) Hello, Aladdin.  Nice to have you on the show.  Can we call you 'Al?' Or maybe just 'Din?'  Or how bout 'Laddi?'  (GENIE disappears, then a dog wrapped in plaid jumps in.) Sounds like 'Here, boy! C'mon, Laddi!' ALADDIN:    (Shaking his head) I must have hit my head harder than I thought. GENIE:  (Still a dog) Do you smoke?  Mind if I do? (Dog poofs into smoke, then back to the GENIE.  ABU screeches wildly.)  Oh, sorry Cheetah--hope I didn't singe the fur!  Hey, Rugman!  Haven't seen you in a few millennia!  Slap me some tassel!  Yo! Yeah! (CARPET flies over and high fives the GENIE. GENIE looks at ALADDIN.)  Say, you're a lot smaller than my last master. (Lifts his beer-gut.)  Either that or I'm gettin' bigger.  Look at me from the side--do I look different to you? ALADDIN:    Wait a minute!  I'm--your master? GENIE:  (Slaps a diploma in ALADDIN's hand and a mortarboard on his head.)  That's right!  He can be taught!! What would you wish of me, (as Arnold Schwarzenegger)  the ever impressive,(inside a cube) the long contained, (as a ventriloquist with a dummy) often imitated, (tosses the dummy aside) but never duplicated-- DUP. GENIES:    Duplicated, duplicated,  duplicated, duplicated,  duplicated,  duplicated, duplicated, duplicated, duplicated. GENIE:  (Says it like a ring announcer at a boxing match.) Genie!  Of!  The Lamp!  (Goes into Ed Sullivan)  Right here direct from the lamp, right here for your enjoyment wish fulfillment. Thank youuuuu! ALADDIN:    Whoa!  Wish fulfillment? GENIE:  Three wishes to be exact.  And ix-nay on the wishing for more wishes.  (Turns into a slot machine, arm pulls down and three GENIEs appear in the windows.)  That's it--three.  (Three GENIE caballeros come out of the slot.)  Uno, dos, tres. (Changes into b/w Groucho Marx.)  No substitutions, exchanges or refunds.  (The duck drops with the secret word \"Refunds.' ALADDIN:    (To ABU) Now I know I'm dreaming. GENIE:  (Music for \"Friend Like Me\" begins) Master, I don't think you quite realize what you've got here! So why don't you just ruminate, whilst I illuminate the possibilities.  (GENIE lights up like a fluorescent light) Well Ali Baba had them forty thieves Scheherazadie had a thousand tales But master you in luck 'cause up your sleeve You got a brand of magic never fails! (GENIE produces 40 thieves who surround ALADDIN with swords. GENIE appears in his vest, then sticks his arms out and boxes the thieves into submission.) You got some power in your corner now Some heavy ammunition in your camp You got some punch, pizzazz, yahoo and how See all you gotta do is rub that lamp And I'll say (Boxing ring appears, ALADDIN in the corner, being massaged by GENIE.  Then GENIE turns into a pile of fireworks and explodes.  Then GENIE appears inside lamp and grabs ALADDIN's hand and rubs lamp with it.) Mister Aladdin sir What will your pleasure be? Let me take your order, jot it down You ain't never had a friend like me No no no! (GENIE produces a table and chairs, then writes down things on a note pad, like a waiter. ) Life is your restaurant And I'm your maitre' d! C'mon whisper what it is you want You ain't never had a friend like me. (GENIE appears as a plate of chicken, then returns to normal, but enlarges his ear to listen to ALADDIN.  Finally, he explodes into four duplicate GENIEs.) Yes sir, we pride ourselves on service You're the boss, the king, the shah! Say what you wish, it's yours!  True dish How about a little more Baklava? (The GENIEs give him a shave, haircut and manicure, then ALADDIN appears in a comfy chair (eh?)  surrounded by the treasure and being fanned by women.  The GENIE appears and fills the screen with baklava.) Try some of column 'A' Try all of column 'B' I'm in the mood to help you dude You ain't never had a friend like me (ALADDIN rises up on a column of food with a giant A on top, then jumps to another column with a B on top.  He falls off and is caught by a cushion held by GENIE.  He opens his mouth, and his tongue turns into a staircase.  A miniature GENIE dressed like a magician comes out.) (The mini GENIE does a little dance with the GENIE's two giant hands.  At the end, they surround the mini GENIE and squish him into nothing.) Can your friends do this? Do your friends do that? Do your friends pull this out their little hat Can your friends go poof! Well looky here Can your friends go Abracadabra, let 'er rip And then make the sucker disappear? (The GENIE pulls off his head, duplicates it, then juggles them. He tosses them to ALADDIN, who juggles with one hand and spins one of the heads on his fingertip like a basketball.  He tosses the heads back onto the GENIE, who proceeds to try and pull himself out of a hat at his base.  He spirals around and around until he turns into a white rabbit.  The rabbit transforms into a purple dragon (very reminiscent of Figment from EPCOT Center). The dragon breathes fire, which turns into three HAREM GIRLS, who dance around ALADDIN.  Just as he begins to enjoy them, they disappear.) So don't you sit there slack jawed, buggy eyed I'm here to answer all your midday prayers You got me bona fide, certified You got a genie for a charg? d'affairs! I got a powerful urge to help you out So what you wish I really want to know You got a wish that's three miles long, no doubt So all you gotta do is rub like so, and oh! (GENIE imitates what he is calling ALADDIN, then turns into a certificate which rolls up and surrounds ALADDIN.  GENIE pulls a list {written in Arabic} out of ALADDIN's ear, which he uses to rub his behind like drying off after a shower.) Mister Aladdin, sir, have a wish or two or three I'm on the job, you big nabob You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend You ain't never...had a... friend... like...me! You ain't never had a friend like me! (The dancing HAREM GIRLS reappear, and ALADDIN leans in to kiss one. She turns into the GENIE, who zaps four dancing elephants into existence.  To the other direction, he zaps in four dancing camels, and a grand finale dancing number ensues.  ABU grabs as much gold as he can, but the GENIE wraps everything up in a cyclone and zaps it away until they're all back in the cave.  GENIE has a neon \"APPLAUSE\" sign on his back. ABU turns his hat over and sees that is is empty.) GENIE:  So what'll it be, master? ALADDIN:    You're gonna grant me any three wishes I want? GENIE:  (As William F. Buckley) Ah, almost.  There are a few provisos, a couple of quid pro quos ALADDIN:    Like? GENIE:  Ah, rule number one: I can't kill anybody.  (He slices his head off with his finger.)  So don't ask.  Rule two: I can't make anyone fall in love with anyone else.  (Head turns into a big pair of lips which kiss ALADDIN.)  You little punim, there. (Lies flat, then gets up and transforms into a zombie.) Rule three: I can't bring people back from the dead.  It's not a pretty picture, (He grabs ALADDIN and shakes him) I don't like doing it!  (He poofs back to normal.)  Other than that, you got it! ALADDIN:    (Looks at ABU as if plotting) Ah, provisos?  You mean limitations?  On wishes? (To ABU) Some all powerful genie--can't even bring people back from the dead. I don't know, Abu--he probably can't even get us out of this cave.  Looks like we're gonna have to find a way out of here-- (They start to leave, but a big blue foot stomps down in front of them.) GENIE:  Excuse me?  Are you lookin' at me?  Did you rub my lamp? Did you wake me up, did you bring me here?  And all of a sudden, you're walkin' out on me?  (Gets madder and madder) I don't think so, not right now.  You're gettin' your wishes, so siddown!  (They all get on CARPET. GENIE takes the form of a stewardess, with lots of arms pointing out the exits.)  In case of emergency, the exits are here, here, here, here,here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, anywhere!  Keep your hands and arms inside the carpet.  Weeee'rrrrrreee...outta here! (The CARPET and passengers fly out of the sand in the desert and off into the distance.  Cut to int. of SULTAN's chamber. JAFAR is there with IAGO, JASMINE and the SULTAN.) SULTAN: Jafar, this is an outrage.  If it weren't for all your years of loyal service... . From now on, you are to discuss sentencing of prisoners with me, before they are beheaded. JAFAR:  I assure you, your highness, it won't happen again. SULTAN: Jasmine, Jafar, now let's put this whole messy business behind us.  Please? JAFAR:  My most abject and humblest apologies to you as well, princess.  (He takes her hand to kiss it, but she yanks it away.) JASMINE:    At least some good will come of my being forced to marry.  When I am queen, I will have the power to get rid of you. SULTAN: That's nice.  All settled, then.  Now, Jasmine, getting back to this suitor business, (he looks and sees Jasmine walking out) Jasmine? Jasmine!  (He runs after her.) JAFAR:  If only I had gotten that lamp! IAGO:       (As JASMINE) I will have the power to get rid of you!  D'oh!  To think--we gotta keep kissing up to that chump, and his chump daughter for the rest of our lives... JAFAR:  No, Iago.  Only until she finds a chump husband. Then she'll have us banished--or beheaded! BOTH:       Eeewww! IAGO:       (Has an idea) Oh!  Wait a minute!  Wait a minute! Jafar?  What if you were the chump husband? JAFAR:  (He looks at IAGO in insult)  What? IAGO:       Okay, you marry the princess,all right? Then, uh, you become sultan! JAFAR:  Oh!Marry the shrew?  I become sultan.  The idea has merit! IAGO:       Yes, merit! Yes!  And then we drop papa-in-law and the little woman off a cliff!  (Dive bombs into the floor)  Kersplat! JAFAR:  Iago, I love the way your foul little mind works! (Both laugh as we cut to an oasis in the desert, where CARPET is coming in for a landing.) GENIE:  (Still as stewardess) Thank you for choosing Magic Carpet for all your travel needs.  Don't stand until the rug has come to a complete stop.  (As ALADDIN and ABU get off down the stairway formed by CARPET) Thank you.  Good bye, good bye!  Thank you! Good bye!  (Back to normal)  Well, now.  How about that, Mr.  doubting mustafa? ALADDIN:    Oh, you sure showed me.  Now about my three wishes- GENIE:  Dost mine ears deceive me?  Three? You are down by ONE, boy! ALADDIN:    Ah, no--I never actually wished to get out of the cave.  You did that on your own. (GENIE thinks for a second, then his jaw drops.  He turns into a sheep.) GENIE:  Well, don't I feel just sheepish?  All right, you baaaaad boy,  but no more freebies. ALADDIN:    Fair deal.  So, three wishes.  I want them to be good.  (To GENIE) What would you wish for? GENIE:  Me?  No one's ever asked me that before. Well, in my case, ah, forget it. ALADDIN:    What?  No, tell me. GENIE:  Freedom. ALADDIN:    You're a prisoner? GENIE:  It's all part-and-parcel, the whole genie gig. (Grows gigantic, voice echoes) Phenomenal cosmic powers!  (Shrinks down, cramped in MAGIC LAMP.) Itty bitty living space ALADDIN:    Genie, that's terrible. GENIE:  (Comes out of the LAMP) But, oh--to be free.  Not have to go \"Poof! What do you need? Poof! What do you need? Poof! What do you need?\"  To be my own master, such a thing would be greater than all the magic and all the treasures in all  the world! But what am I talking about, here?  Let's get real here.  It's not gonna happen.  Genie, wake up and smell the hummus ALADDIN:    Why not? GENIE:  The only way I get outta this is if my master wishes me out.  So you can guess how often that's happened. ALADDIN:    I'll do it. I'll set you free. GENIE:  (Head turns into Pinocchio's with a long nose) Uh huh, right.  Whoop! ALADDIN:    No, really, I promise.  (He pushes the nose back in and GENIE's head returns to normal.) After make my first two wishes, I'll use my third wish to set you free.   (He holds out his hand) GENIE:  Well, here's hopin'.  (Shakes ALADDIN's hand.) O.K.   Let's make some magic!  (Turns into a magician.)  So how 'bout it.  What is it you want most? ALADDIN:    Well, there's this girl-- GENIE:  Eehhh! (Like a buzzer, and GENIE's chest shows a heart with a cross through it.)  Wrong!  I can't make anybody fall in love, remember? ALADDIN:    Oh, but Genie.  She's smart and fun and... GENIE:  Pretty? ALADDIN:    Beautiful.  She's got these eyes that just...and this hair, wow...and her smile. GENIE:  (Sitting in a Parisian cafe with ABU and CARPET.) Ami.  C'est l'amour. ALADDIN:    But she's the princess.  To even have a chance, I'd have to be a--hey, can you make me a prince? GENIE:  Let's see here.  (Has a \"Royal Cookbook\".) Uh, chicken a'la king? (Pulls out a chicken with a crown on its head)  Nope.  Alaskan king crab? (Yanks out his finger, and we see SEBASTIAN the crab from \"The Little Mermaid\"  clamped on.)  Ow, I hate it when they do that.  Caesar's salad? (A dagger comes out and tries to stab him.) Et tu, Brute?  Ah, to make a prince.  (Looks slyly at ALADDIN.)  Now is that an official wish?  Say the words! ALADDIN:    Genie, I wish for you to make me a prince! GENIE:  All right!  Woof woof woof woof! (Takes on square shoulders and looks like Arsenio Hall. Then becomes a tailor/fashion designer.)  First, that fez and vest combo is much too third century. These patches--what are we trying to say--beggar?  No! Let's work with me here. (He takes ALADDIN's measurements, snaps his fingers and ALADDIN is outfitted in his prince costume.)  I like it, muy macho!  Now, still needs something.  What does it say to me?  It says mode of transportation.  Excuse me, monkey boy!  Aqui, over here!  (ABU tries to cover himself with CARPET, but GENIE zaps him and he flies over.) ABU:        Uh oh! GENIE:  Here he comes, (ALADDIN and GENIE are on a game show set, where ALADDIN stands behind a podium with \"AL\" on it.)  And what better way to make your grand entrance on the streets of Agrabah, than riding your very own brand new camel!  Watch out, it spits!  (A door bearing the GENIE's head on it opens, where ABU is transformed into a camel.  He spits out the side of his mouth on cue.  But the GENIE's not sure.)  Mmm, not enough.  (He snaps his fingers and ABU turns into a fancy white horse.) Still not enough.  Let's see.  What do you need? (The GENIE snaps his fingers repeatedly, turning ABU into:  a duck, an ostrich, a turtle, and a '57 Cadillac, with license plate \"ABU 1.\"   (That one's a guess, I don't know cars, but judging by the tail fins, 'nuff said.)  Finally, he's returned to normal.)  Yes!!  Esalalumbo,  shimin dumbo!  Whoa!! (And on the keyword of the spell, Dumbo, ABU turns into an elephant.  CARPET struggles to get out from under ABU's size 46 feet.)  Talk about your trunk space, check this action out! (ABU sees his reflection in a pool of water, then jumps into a tree. The tree naturally bends right back down to the ground, where ABU hangs on and looks at ALADDIN upside down.) ALADDIN:    Abu, you look good. GENIE:  He's got the outfit, he's got the elephant, but we're not through yet.  Hang on to your turban, kid, cause we're gonna make you a star! (We zoom out slowly with the oasis in the distance, as fireworks begin to explode outward.  Cut to a CU of a pile of toys. (Look for the BEAST here.)  We tilt up and see the SULTAN balancing them.  He carefully balances the last piece on top, then sits back and sighs.  JAFAR storms in, though, and the pile collapses.) JAFAR:  Sire, I have found a solution to the problem with your daughter. IAGO:   Awk!  The problem with your daughter! SULTAN: Oh, really? JAFAR:  (Unrolling a scroll) Right here.  \"If the princess has not chosen a husband by the appointed time, then the sultan shall choose for her.\" SULTAN: But Jasmine hated all those suitors!  (He tries to stuff a cracker into IAGO's mouth.  IAGO backs away.  The SULTAN absentmindedly pulls the cracker back.)  How could I choose someone she hates? (IAGO is relieved, but the SULTAN quickly stuffs a cracker in his mouth.) JAFAR:  Not to worry, my liege.  There is more.  If, in the event a suitable prince cannot be found, a princess must then be wed to...hmm...interesting. SULTAN: What?  Who? JAFAR:  The royal vizier!  Why, that would be...me! SULTAN: Why, I thought the law says that only a prince can marry a princess, I'm quite sure. JAFAR:  Desperate times call for desperate measures, my lord.  (He pulls out the staff and hypnotizes the SULTAN with it.) SULTAN: Yes...desperate measures... JAFAR:  You will order the princess to marry me. SULTAN: I...will order...the princess...to...(the spell breaks momentarily)...but you're so old! JAFAR:  (Holds the staff closer) The princess will marry me! SULTAN: The princess will marry...(the spell is again broken, this time by the trumpet fanfare of \"Prince Ali\".)  What? What is that?  That music!  Ha ha ha. Jafar., you must come and see this! (We see an advancing parade, led by what appears to be the GENIE in human form as a MAJOR.) MARCHERS:   Make way for Prince Ali! SWORDSMEN: Say hey!  It's Prince Ali! MAJOR:  Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar, Hey you, let us through, it's a bright new star, Now come, be the first on your block to meet his eye! Make way, here he comes, Ring bells, bang the drums. You're gonna love this guy Prince Ali, fabulous he, Ali Ababwa! Genuflect, show some respect Down on one knee Now try your best to stay calm Brush up your Sunday Salaam And come and meet his spectacular coterie. (IAGO is dancing to the music until JAFAR glares at him.  The MAJOR \"wheelbarrows\" six men up onto ABU's trunk.  They stand on each other's shoulders as ALI shakes hands.) Prince Ali, mighty is he, Ali Ababwa! Strong as ten regular men, definitely He faced the galloping hordes A hundred bad guys with swords Who sent those goons to their lords, why Prince Ali! (The pile collapses on ALI, but a GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt zaps the pile and he ends up holding them all up in an acrobatic wheel formation.  The GENIE turns into an old man, then a child and speaks the last two lines to the crowd.) CHORUS OF MEN:(Carrying the camels) He's got seventy-five golden camels! HARRY:  Don't they look lovely, June? CHORUS OF WOMEN:    (On a float)  Purple peacocks, he's got fifty-three! JUNE:   Fabulous, Harry, I love the feathers! GENIE:  (GENIE is off screen, a giant balloon gorilla proceeds down the parade) When it comes to exotic type mammals Has he got a zoo, I'm telling you It's a world class menagerie! (GENIE pops in as a leopard, then a goat, and speaks the last two lines to the two children from earlier.  We cut to a balcony, where three HAREM GIRLS are joined by the HAREM GENIE.) GENIE: GIRLS: (in couterpoint) Prince Ali, Handsome is he, Ali Ababwa There's no question this Ali's alluring That physique, how can I speak Never ordinary, never boring Weak at the knee Everything about the man just plain impresses Well, get on out in that square He's a wonder, he's a whiz, a wonder Adjust your veil and prepare He's about to pull my heart asunder To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali! And I absolutely love the way he dresses! (JASMINE has been watching from the balcony of the palace.  She humphs it off, then leaves.) CHORUS: He's got ninety-five white Persian monkeys! And to view them, he charges no fee! He's got slaves, he's got servants and flunkies! They bow to his whim, love serving him They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali!  Prince Ali! (ALADDIN throws gold coins out to the people, who rush over to collect them.  ABU and the parade march up the steps of the palace and inside.  The SULTAN runs back inside to the door to the throne room, but JAFAR stands in front of the door. Suddenly, it bursts open, with ABU leading the way, and crushing JAFAR and IAGO behind the door.) GENIE:  Prince Ali! Amorous he!  Ali Ababwa Heard your princess was a sight lovely to see! And that,good people, is why He got dolled up and dropped by With sixty elephants, llamas galore With his bears and lions A brass band and more With his forty fakirs, his cooks, his bakers His birds that warble on key Make way for Prince Ali! (More and more fanfare build up until ALADDIN flies off ABU's back on MAGIC CARPET and flies down to the SULTAN.  JAFAR slams the door shut.) SULTAN: (Clapping) Splendid, absolutely marvelous. ALADDIN:    (Takes on a deeper voice.)  Ahem.  Your majesty, I have journeyed from afar to seek your daughter's hand. SULTAN: Prince Ali Ababwa!  Of course.  I'm delighted to meet you.  (He rushes over and shakes ALI's hand.) This is my royal vizier, Jafar.  He's delighted too. JAFAR:  (Extremely dryly) Ecstatic.  I'm afraid, Prince Abooboo-- ALADDIN:    --Ababwa! JAFAR:  Whatever.  You cannot just parade in here uninvited and expect to-- SULTAN: ...by Allah, this is quite a remarkable device. (He tugs at the tassels, and they tug his moustache.)  I don't suppose I might... ALADDIN:    Why certainly, your majesty.  Allow me. (He helps the SULTAN up onto the CARPET, and he plops down. JAFAR pins the CARPET down on the floor with the staff.) JAFAR:  Sire, I must advise against this-- SULTAN: --Oh, button up, Jafar.  Learn to have a little fun. (He kicks away the staff and CARPET and SULTAN fly away.  IAGO, who was standing on the head of the staff, falls down, repeatedly bopping the staff with his beak as he descends.  SULTAN and CARPET fly high into the ceiling, then begin a dive-bomb attack, flying under ABU, scaring him.  The flight continues in the background, while JAFAR and ALI talk in the foreground.) JAFAR:  Just where did you say you were from? ALADDIN:    Oh, much farther than you've traveled, I'm sure. JAFAR:  Try me.  (IAGO lands on the staff.) SULTAN: Look out, Polly! (They all duck in time as the CARPET whizzes centimetres over their heads.  CARPET returns and the SULTAN chases IAGO around the room.) IAGO:       Hey, watch it. Watch it with the dumb rug! (The CARPET zooms underneath IAGO, who sighs, wipes his brow, and crashes into a pillar.  He crashes to the floor, and his head is circled by miniature SULTANS on CARPETS, saying \"Have a cracker, have a cracker.  The real SULTAN begins his final approach.) SULTAN: Out of the way, I'm coming in to land.  Jafar, watch this!  (He lands.) JAFAR:  Spectacular, your highness. SULTAN: Ooh, lovely.  Yes, I do seem to have a knack for it.  (CARPET walks over to ABU dizzily, then collapses.  ABU catches it.)  This is a very impressive youth. And a prince as well.   (Whispers to JAFAR) If we're lucky, you won't have to marry Jasmine after all. JAFAR:  I don't trust him, sire. SULTAN: Nonsense.  One thing I pride myself on Jafar, I'm an excellent judge of character. IAGO:   Oh, excellent judge, yeah, sure...not!!! SULTAN: Jasmine will like this one! ALADDIN:    And I'm pretty sure I'll like Princess Jasmine! JAFAR:  Your highness, no.  I must intercede on Jasmine's behalf.  (JASMINE hears this and gets mad.) This boy is no different than the others.  What makes him think he is worthy of the princess? ALADDIN:    Your majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa! (He pricks JAFAR's goatee, which springs out in all directions.)  Just let her meet me.  I will win your daughter! JASMINE:    How dare you!  (They all look at her surprised.) All of you, standing around deciding my future?  I am not a prize to be won!  (She storms out.) SULTAN: Oh, dear.  Don't worry, Prince Ali.  Just give Jasmine time to cool down.  (They exit.) JAFAR:  I think it's time to say good bye to Prince Abooboo. (Diss to JASMINE on her balcony at night.  We tilt down and find ALADDIN and company in the courtyard.) ALADDIN:    What am I going to do?  Jasmine won't even let me talk to her.  I should have known I couldn't pull off this stupid prince wish.  (ABU struggles with his elephant paws to open a banana.  He squishes it, and the banana squirts into his eye.  He then tosses the banana peel into a heaping pile of the same.) GENIE:  (to carpet, playing chess) So move!  (CARPET does, knocking a black piece off the board.)  Hey. That's a good move.  (As Rodney Dangerfield) I can't believe it--I'm losing to a rug. ALADDIN:    Genie, I need help. GENIE:  (as Jack Nicholson) All right, sparky, here's the deal.  You wanna court the little lady, you gotta be a straight shooter, do ya follow me? ALADDIN:    What? GENIE:  (Back to normal, wearing a mortarboard. He points out his words on a blackboard)  Tell her the...TRUTH!!! ALADDIN:    No way!  If Jasmine found out I was really some crummy street rat, she'd laugh at me. (He puts on his turban, which lights up as the GENIE.) GENIE:  A woman appreciates a man who can make her laugh! (ALADDIN pulls the chain turning off the light. GENIE comes out holding the real turban.)  Al, all joking aside, you really oughtta be yourself. ALADDIN:    Hey, that's the last thing I want to  be.  Okay, I'm gonna go see her.  I gotta be smooth, cool, confident.  How do I look? GENIE:  (Sadly) Like a prince. (ALADDIN flies up to the balcony on CARPET.  JASMINE is on her bed, sighing.  RAJAH is by her side.) ALADDIN:    (From a distance) Princess Jasmine? JASMINE:    Who's there? ALADDIN:    It's me--Prince Ali.  Ahem--(Then he jumps to his deep voice) Prince Ali Ababwa. JASMINE:    I do not want to see you. ALADDIN:    No, no, please princess.  Give me a chance. (RAJAH growls and advances on him.) JAFAR:  Just leave me alone. ALADDIN:    Down kitty! GENIE:  How's our beau doing? ALADDIN:    Good kitty, take off.  Down kitty. (He takes off his turban to brush RAJAH away.) JASMINE:    (She looks at him thinking she has seen him before.)  Wait, wait.  Do I know you? ALADDIN:    (Quickly replaces his turban) Uh, no, no. JASMINE:    You remind me of someone I met in  the marketplace. ALADDIN:    The marketplace?  (A bee buzzes around his head.) I have servants that go to the marketplace for me. Why I even have servants who go to the marketplace for my servants, so it couldn't have been me you met. JASMINE:    (She looks disappointed.)  No, I guess not. BEE:        (It's the GENIE) Enough about you, Casanova.  Talk about her! She's smart,  fun, the hair, the eyes. Anything--pick a feature! ALADDIN:    Um, Princess Jasmine?  You're very... BEE:        Wonderful, glorious, magnificent, punctual! ALADDIN:    Punctual! JASMINE:    Punctual? BEE:        Sorry. ALADDIN:    Beautiful. BEE:        Nice recovery. JASMINE:    Hmm.  I'm rich too, you know. ALADDIN:    Yeah! JASMINE:    The daughter of a sultan ALADDIN:    I know. JASMINE:    A fine prize for any  prince to marry. ALADDIN:    Uh, right.  Right.  A prince like me. BEE:        (Buzzing in his ear) Warning! Warning! JASMINE:    Right, a prince like you.  And every other stuffed  shirt, swaggering, peacock I've met! BEE:        (Rear end on fire, wearing goggles and crashing) Mayday! Mayday! JASMINE:    Just go jump off a balcony! (She turns and walks away) ALADDIN:    What? BEE:        Stop her! Stop her! Do you want me to sting her? ALADDIN:    (Swats at bee) Buzz off! BEE:        Okay, fine.  But remember--bee yourself! (BEE buzzes into his turban) ALADDIN:    Yeah, right! JASMINE:    What!?! ALADDIN:    Uh, you're right.  You aren't just some prize to be won.  (He looks disappointed.)  You should be free to make your own choice.  (JASMINE and RAJAH look at each other in confusion.)  I'll go now. (He steps up on the ledge and drops off.) JASMINE:    No! ALADDIN:    (Pokes his head up from over the edge) What?  What? JASMINE:    (Now she's amazed) How--how are you doing that? ALADDIN:    It's a magic carpet. JASMINE:    It's lovely.  (CARPET takes JASMINE's hand with a tassel.) ALADDIN:    You, uh, you don't want to go for a ride, do you? We could get out of the palace, see the world. JASMINE:    Is it safe? ALADDIN:    Sure.  Do you trust me? JASMINE:    (She looks at him at the saying of that all- important line) What? ALADDIN:    (Extends his hand the same as before) Do you trust me? JASMINE:    (Gets a sly grin on her face) Yes. (She takes his hand and gets up on CARPET.  It zooms into the sky, knocking them both into sitting positions.  The music of \"A Whole New World\" swells.  JASMINE looks back and sees RAJAH looking up at her questioningly.  She gasps as they fly over the palace wall and into the sky.) ALADDIN:    I can show you the world Shining, shimmering, splendid. Tell me princess, now when did you last Let your heart decide? (CARPET zooms down through the town, stopping slightly to pick a flower.  It gives the flower to ALADDIN, who gives it to JASMINE. She smiles.) I can open your eyes Take you wonder by wonder Over, sideways, and under On a magic carpet ride A whole new world! A new fantastic point of view No one to tell us no Or where to go Or say we're only dreaming (JASMINE looks back and watches Agrabah disappear from sight.  CARPET flies in and out of the clouds.) JASMINE:    A whole new world A dazzling place I never knew But when I'm way up here It's crystal clear That now I'm in a whole new world with you! ALADDIN:    Now I'm in a whole new world with you! (They each catch a small cloud as CARPET continues the flight.  It then circles a pillar of clouds, giving a swirly look to it.) JASMINE:    Unbelievable sights Indescribable feeling Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling Through an endless diamond sky (They join a flock of birds in the sky.  One of them looks terrified and squawks.  CARPET does somersaults and flips, at times putting ALADDIN and JASMINE in free-fall, but catching them.  They then zoom above the clouds where a starry night awaits them.) JASMINE:    A whole new world! ALADDIN:    Don't you dare close your eyes JASMINE:    An hundred thousand things to see ALADDIN:    Hold your breath--it gets better! JASMINE:    I'm like a shooting star, I've come so far I can't go back to where I used to be! (They zoom down over a river, apparently the Nile, for beyond the ship's sails are the Great Pyramids.  They wave at a worker sculpting the complete nose of the Sphinx.  He smiles, but chisels too much and breaks off the front section of the nose.) ALADDIN:    A whole new world! JASMINE:    Every turn a surprise ALADDIN:    With new horizons to pursue JASMINE:    Every moment, red-letter BOTH:   I'll chase them anywhere There's time to spare Let me share this whole new world with you A whole new world That's where we'll be (They fly through Greece, where ALADDIN grabs an apple from a tree and rolls it down his arm to JASMINE, who is now sure she is dealing with ALADDIN, not PRINCE ALI.) ALADDIN:    A thrilling chase JASMINE:    A wondrous place BOTH:       For you and me! (CARPET hovers along over a lake, and we see the reflection of the moon in the lake.  Fireworks burst and we see the couple at a Chinese New Year celebration, sitting on a rooftop.) JASMINE:    It's all so magical. ALADDIN:    Yeah. JASMINE:    (She looks at him and decides to burst the bubble) It's a shame Abu had to miss this. ALADDIN:    Nah.  He hates fireworks.  (CARPET looks up realizing what is happening.)  He doesn't really like flying either. (And now ALADDIN realizes it) That is...oh no! JASMINE:    (She pulls off his turban) You are the boy from the market!  I knew it.  Why did you lie to me? ALADDIN:    Jasmine, I'm sorry. JASMINE:    Did you think I was stupid? ALADDIN:    No! JASMINE:    That I wouldn't figure it out? ALADDIN:    No.  I mean, I hoped you wouldn't.  No, that's not what I meant. JASMINE:    Who are you?  Tell me the truth! ALADDIN:    The truth? (He looks at CARPET who wave him on, giving up hope.)  The truth...the truth is...I sometimes dress as a commoner to escape the pressures of palace life.  (CARPET slumps down in defeat.)  But I really am a prince! (The feather on his turban falls down over his eyes.) JASMINE:    Why didn't you just tell me? ALADDIN:    Well, you know, um...royalty going out into the city in disguise, it sounds a little strange, don't you think? JASMINE:    Not that strange. (She flicks up the feather and cuddles with him.  CARPET puts a tassel under his \"chin\" and looks mystified.  Dissolve to ext. of palace balcony, where ALADDIN and JASMINE return.  CARPET forms a set of steps and she descends.  ALADDIN then descends just below the balcony.) JASMINE:    Good night, my handsome prince. ALADDIN:    Sleep well, princess. (They slowly lean forward to kiss, but CARPET bumps him up and they kiss sooner than expected.  She walks away slowly then turns and looks at him. Finally she enters her room through the curtain.) ALADDIN:    Yes!  (He falls back onto the CARPET, who descends to the ground.) For the first time in my life, things are starting to go right. ALADDIN:    Hey!  What?  (A gag is tied around his mouth. Muffled words) Abu!  Abu!  (We see the elephant hanging from a net tied in a tree.) GUARD:  Hold him! (Shackles are placed on his feet and his hands.  Another GUARD ties CARPET in a knot around a tree.) JAFAR:  I'm afraid you've worn out your welcome, Prince Abooboo.  (Walks away.)  Make sure he's never found. (A GUARD hits him in the head, and he falls unconscious.  Cut to a cliff, where GUARDS laugh as ALADDIN's body drops into the water. He is conscious now, but his feet are tied to a rock.  The rock hits the sea bottom, then the turban lands and the lamp tumbles out.  He sees this and struggles to rub the lamp.  However, he loses consciousness and falls to the floor.  The lamp, unsettled by his movement, rolls down and rubs against his hands. It shakes, and GENIE emerges with a bath brush, rubber duckie, and shower cap) GENIE:  Never fails.  Get in the bath and there's a rub at the lamp.  (Squeaks the duck)  Hello.  (Sees unconscious ALADDIN) Al?  Al!  Kid, snap out of it! You can't cheat on this one!  I can't help you unless you make a wish.  You have to say  \"Genie I want you to save my life.\"  Got it?  Okay.  C'mon Aladdin!!  (He grabs ALADDIN by the shoulders and shakes him.  His head goes up, then falls.)  I'll take that as a yes.  (Head turns into a siren.) Wooga!  Wooga!  (Turns into a submarine.)  Up scope!  (He babbles in something that sounds like German.  On the surface, a giant water spout emerges, and lands on top of the cliff.  ALADDIN reawakes and coughs the water out of his lungs.) Don't you scare me like that! ALADDIN:    Genie, I--uh, I-uh...(He can't think of how to say it, so they just hug each other.)  Thanks, Genie. GENIE:  Oh, Al.  I'm gettin' kind of fond of you, kid.  Not that I want to pick out curtains or anything. (Cut to JASMINE in her room, humming \"A Whole New World\" and brushing her hair.  The SULTAN appears in one of the double doors,hypnotized.) SULTAN: Jasmine! JASMINE:    Oh, father--I just had the most wonderful time. I'm so happy. SULTAN: (Still monotone from the hypnosis) You should be, Jasmine. I have chosen a husband for you. JASMINE:    What? SULTAN: (The other door opens and reveals JAFAR.)  You will wed Jafar. JAFAR:  You're speechless, I see.  A fine quality in a wife. JASMINE:    I will never marry you.  (She goes to the SULTAN) Father, I choose Prince Ali! JAFAR:  Prince Ali left! ALADDIN:    Better check your crystal ball  again, Jafar! JASMINE:    Prince Ali! IAGO:       How in the he--(back to parrot-ese)--uh, awk! ALADDIN:    Tell them the truth, Jafar!  You tried to have me killed. JAFAR:  What?  (He goes to the SULTAN)  Ridiculous nonsense, your highness.  He is obviously lying. SULTAN: Obviously...lying. JASMINE:    Father, what's wrong with you? ALADDIN:    I know! (ALADDIN grabs the staff and smashes it on the floor. JAFAR flinches and the spell is broken for good.) SULTAN: Oh, oh, oh my! ALADDIN:    Your highness, Jafar's been controlling you with this!  (He advances the staff) SULTAN: What?  Jafar?  You, you traitor! JAFAR:  Your majesty, all of this can be explained. SULTAN: Guards! Guards! IAGO:       Well, that's it--we're dead, forget about it.  Just dig a grave for both of us.  We're dead. (But JAFAR sees the lamp in ALADDIN's pocket.  He makes a move, but is grabbed by guards.) SULTAN: Arrest Jafar at once. JAFAR:  This is not done yet, boy! (JAFAR pulls a vial from his pocket.  ALADDIN sees this and rushes him, but JAFAR throws the vial to the floor.  A large red cloud appears.  When it is gone, so is JAFAR.) SULTAN: Find him, search everywhere! ALADDIN:    Jasmine, are you all right? JASMINE:    Yes. SULTAN: Jafar, my most trusted counselor, plotting against me all this time.  Just horrible.  How will I ever- Can it be true?  My daughter has finally chosen a suitor? (She nods) Ha ha!  Praise Allah!  You brilliant boy, I could kiss you!   I won't--I'll leave that to my--.  You two will be wed at once! Yes, yes.  And you'll be happy and prosperous, and then my boy, you will be sultan! ALADDIN:    Sultan? SULTAN: Yes, a fine upstanding youth like yourself, a person of your unimpeachable moral character is exactly what this kingdom needs!  (ALADDIN looks concerned at this.) IAGO:       We gotta get outta here!  We gotta get--  I gotta start packing, your highness.  Only essentials. (IAGO starts throwing things out of his cage. JAFAR smiles broadly.)  Travel light! Bring the guns, the weapons, the knives (Stops and takes out a picture of himself    and JAFAR) and how about this picture?  I don't know--I think I'm making a weird face in it. (JAFAR starts to laugh wildly.) Oh, boy--he's gone nuts.  He's cracked.  (IAGO flies down to him and knocks on his head.)  Jafar? Jafar?  Get a grip, Jafar! (JAFAR grabs him around the neck) Good grip! JAFAR:  Prince Ali is nothing more than that ragged urchin Aladdin.  He has the lamp, Iago. IAGO:       Why that miserable-- JAFAR:  But you are going to relieve him of it! IAGO:       Me? ALADDIN:    Sultan?  They want me to be sultan? GENIE:  Huzzah!  Hail the conquering hero!  (Turns into a one-man band.  He sees ALADDIN walk away with his head hung.  He stops, scratches his head, comes up with an idea, then zooms over to ALADDIN.  He holds up his hands like a director scoping a picture and we look through them.)  Aladdin, you've just won the heart of the princess.  What are you gonna do next?  (ALADDIN looks at him, then walks away in sadness to the bed, where he falls on it and sighs. GENIE again is confused, then goes to him and pulls out a script labeled \"Aladdin.\" Whispering: ) Psst, your line is \"I'm going to free the genie.\" Anytime. ALADDIN:    Genie...I can't. GENIE:  Sure you can.  You just go \"Genie, I wish you free.\"  (He grabs ALADDIN's head and uses him as a mock ventriloquist's dummy.  ALADDIN pulls away.) ALADDIN:    I'm serious.  Look, I'm sorry--I really am. But they want to make me sultan--no!, They want to make Prince Ali sultan.  Without you, I'm just Aladdin. GENIE:  Al, you won! ALADDIN:    Because of you!  The only reason anyone thinks I'm anything is because of you.  What if they find out I'm not really a prince?  (Quietly)  What if Jasmine finds out?  I'll lose her.  Genie, I can't keep this up on my own.  I can't wish you free. GENIE:  (Sarcastically) Hey, I understand.  After all, you've lied to everyone else.  Hey, I was beginning to feel left out.  Now, if you'll excuse me, master. (He says the last word in disgust, then poofs back into the lamp.) ABU:        Ohhh. ALADDIN:    Genie, I'm really sorry. (A tongue comes out of the spout and raspberries him.)   Well, fine. (He slams a pillow on top of the LAMP.)  Then just stay in there!  (He looks at ABU and CARPET.)  What are you guys looking at? (They both leave.) Look, I--I'm sorry.  Wait, Abu-- wait--I'm sorry, I didn't-- wait, c'mon.  (He sighs.)  What am I doing? Genie's right--I gotta tell Jasmine the truth. JASMINE:    (From a distance)  Ali, oh Ali--will you come here? ALADDIN:    (Putting on his turban) Well, here goes.  (He walks into the garden.)  Jasmine?  Where are you? (We see IAGO wearing a beak and standing on stilts next to a FLAMINGO in the pond.  He is imitating JASMINE's voice.) IAGO:       Ahem--In the menagerie, hurry. ALADDIN:    I'm coming. (We see ALADDIN hurry past, not noticing the birds.  IAGO laughs, then turns back and looks into the face of a FLAMINGO, who is panting.) FLAMINGO:   D'uh! IAGO:       Ya got a problem, pinky?  (He sweeps the bird's feet out from under it. IAGO runs into the palace and finds the lamp under the pillow.)  Boy, Jafar's gonna be happy to see you!  (Stretches his face like JAFAR's and imitates it.)  Good work, Iago! (Normal) Ah, go on.  (JAFAR) No, really--on a scale of one to ten, you are an eleven! (Normal) Ah, Jafar--you're too kind.  I'm embarrassed, I'm blushing.  (He flies away with the lamp.) (Cut to the palace entrance.  The SULTAN is standing on top, making an announcement to the people.) SULTAN: People of Agrabah, My daughter has finally chosen a suitor! (Cut to behind the curtain, where JASMINE is peeking.  ALADDIN appears at the bottom of the stairs.) ALADDIN:    Jasmine? JASMINE:    Ali, where have you been? ALADDIN:    There's something I've got to tell you. JASMINE:    The whole kingdom has turned out for father's announcement! ALADDIN:    No! But Jasmine, listen to me, please! JASMINE:    Good luck!  (She pushes him out onto the platform with the SULTAN, where he overlooks the entire crowd.) SULTAN: ...Ali Ababwa! ALADDIN:    Oh, boy! IAGO:   Look at them, cheering that little pipsqueak. JAFAR:  Let them cheer. GENIE:  You know Al, I'm getting (turns and sees JAFAR) reallyyyyyy--I don't think you're him.  (He descends and consults a playbill.)  Tonight, the role of Al will be played by a tall, dark and sinister ugly man. JAFAR:  I am your master now.  (He throws GENIE to the ground and puts his foot on GENIE's face.) GENIE:  I was afraid of that. JAFAR:  Genie, grant me my first wish.  I wish to rule on high, as sultan!!! (Cut to ext where dark clouds circle the castle.  The castle shakes. The roof rips off and the SULTAN and ALADDIN duck.) ALADDIN:    Whoa! SULTAN: Bless my soul.  What is this?  What is going on? (His turban lifts off his head.  When he grabs it, his whole body flies up, then is stripped of all his clothing except his boxer shorts.  The clothing reappears on JAFAR.) JAFAR:  Heh heh heh! SULTAN: Jafar, you vile betrayer. IAGO:       That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you. ALADDIN:    Oh, yeah?  Well, we'll just see about that!  (Pulls off his own turban, but finds it empty)  The lamp! JAFAR:  Finders-keepers, Abooboo. (They both look up and see a gigantic GENIE lift the palace into the clouds..  ALADDIN whistles and CARPET flies up to greet him. They fly up near the GENIE's head.) ALADDIN:    Genie!  No! GENIE:  Sorry, kid--I got a new master now.  (He places the palace on top of a mountain.) SULTAN: Jafar, I order you to stop! JAFAR:  There's a new order now--my order!  Finally, you will bow to me! JAFAR:  We'll never bow to you! IAGO:       Why am I not surprised? JAFAR:  If you will not bow before a sultan, then you will cower before a sorcerer!  (To GENIE)  Genie, my second wish--I wish to be the most powerful sorcerer in the world! (GENIE extends his finger.  ALADDIN tries to stop him, but he cannot, and another GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt  strikes JAFAR, returning him to his normal look.) IAGO:       Ladies and gentlemen, a warm Agrabah welcome for Sorcerer Jafar! JAFAR:  Now where were we?  Ah, yes--abject humiliation! (He zaps JASMINE and the SULTAN with his staff, and they both bow to him. RAJAH comes running at him. He zaps RAJAH, and the tiger turns into a kitty- cat.)  Down, boy!  Oh, princess--(lifts her chin with his staff)--there's someone I'm dying to introduce you to. ALADDIN:    (off-camera) Jafar!  Get your hands off her! JAFAR:  Prince Ali Yes, it is he, But not as you know him. Read my lips and come to grips With reality Yes, meet a blast from your past Whose lies were too good to last Say hello to your precious Prince Ali! IAGO:       Or should we say Aladdin? ALADDIN:    Jasmine, I tried to tell you. JAFAR:  So Ali turns out to be merely Aladdin Just a con, need I go on? Take it from me His personality flaws Give me adequate cause To send him packing on a one-way trip So his prospects take a terminal dip His assets frozen, the venue chosen Is the ends of the earth, whoopee! So long, IAGO:       Good bye, see ya! JAFAR:  Ex-Prince Ali! (JAFAR has zapped ABU back to normal.  He sends the two of them into a tall pillar, then launches it like a rocket, but not before CARPET can get in.  F2B, then we see a snowy wasteland, where the pillar crashes and rolls.  It finally comes to a stop. ALADDIN emerges, obviously very cold.) ALADDIN:    Abu?  Abu!  (He looks back at a shivering pile of snow.)  Oh, this is all my fault--I should have freed the genie when I had the chance.  (He digs out ABU and cradles him inside his vest.)  Abu! Are you okay?  I'm sorry, Abu--I made a mess of everything, somehow.  I gotta go back and set things right.  (He starts to walk through the snow, and he eventuallysteps on a frozen CARPET.) Carpet!  (He looks up and sees CARPET is pinned by the pillar.  He tugs to try and free CARPET.  He can't do it, so he begins to remove snow from the base of the pillar.)   Abu, start digging!  That's it!  (Finally, enough snow has been removed, and the pillar begins to roll.  ALADDIN runs away, looks back, then slides into place.  The pillar rolls over him, and when it is gone, ALADDIN and ABU are left sitting in the patch of snow made by the window of the pillar.)  Yeah!  All right!  (He looks up at his turban, made out of scared ABU. CARPET shakes off the snow and rushes over to pick them up.)  Now, back to Agrabah!  Let's go! (We cut back to ext. long shot of Agrabah, shrouded in red clouds. Cut to int. and slow zoom of throne room. IAGO has the SULTAN tied up like a marionette, and JASMINE is chained next to the throne.) IAGO:       Puppet ruler want a cracker? Here's your cracker. Shove 'em all right down your throat.  Here, have lots! JAFAR:  Leave him alone! JAFAR:  It pains me to see you reduced to this, Jasmine. A beautiful desert bloom such as yourself should be on the arm of the most powerful man in the world. (He waves his finger and a crown appears.) What do you say, my dear?  Why,  with you as my queen... JASMINE:    Never! JAFAR:  I'll teach you some respect! (She falls back as he raises his hand to slap her.  Then he stops.)  No. Genie, I have decided to make my final wish.  I wish for Princess Jasmine to fall desperately in love with me. GENIE:  (Again as Buckley) Ah, master-- there are a few addendas, some quid pro quo- JAFAR:  Don't talk back to me, you stupid blue lout!  You will do what I order you to do, slave! (JASMINE looks up and sees ALADDIN in the window, motioning her to play along.) JASMINE:    (She stands and puts the crown on her head.) Jafar!  I never realized how incredibly handsome you are. JAFAR:  That's better.  (He pulls the GENIE's jaw up like a shade.)  Now, pussycat, tell me more about...myself. JASMINE:    You're tall, well dressed... (JAFAR walks over to her.  ALADDIN jumps down with ABU and GENIE sees them.) GENIE:  Al!  Al, little buddy! ALADDIN:    Shh! GENIE:  (Literally zips his mouth shut, then unzips it.) Al, I can't help you--I work for senor psychopath, now.  (His head turns into JAFAR's, then back.) ALADDIN:    Hey--I'm a street rat, remember? (He rezips GENIE's mouth.)  I'll improvise. (He slides down a pile of coins and hides close to JAFAR and JASMINE. JAFAR's back is to ALADDIN.) JAFAR:  Go on. JASMINE:    And your beard...is so...twisted!  (She has her arms around him.  She pretends to twist with her finger, but she is actually motioning for ALADDIN to come over.  He makes his move.  IAGO sees him.) IAGO:       Jaf--mmmmmm! (ABU grabs him and covers his mouth.) JAFAR:  And the street rat? JASMINE:    What street rat? (They are about to kiss when IAGO manages to knock over a bowl.  JAFAR turns to look, but JASMINE grabs him back and kisses him.  ALADDIN looks disgusted.  IAGO and ABU both look disgusted.) ABU:        Yuck! JAFAR:  That was--(he sees ALADDIN's reflection in her crown.) You!!  How many times do I have to kill you, boy? (He zaps ALADDIN.  JASMINE rushes him, and he throws her to the ground.  ALADDIN rushes and grabs the staff.) ALADDIN:    Get the lamp! (JASMINE runs to it.  JAFAR, however, shakes off ALADDIN, then zaps her into an hourglass.) JAFAR:  Ah, ah, ah, princess--Your time is up! ALADDIN:    Jasmine! IAGO:       Oh, nice shot, Jaf-- (he is knocked out by ABU.) JAFAR:  Don't toy with me!  (He's zapped into a toy monkey. ALADDIN:    Abu! JAFAR:  Things are unraveling fast, now boy. (CARPET is zapped and unravels.  ALADDIN again rushes for the lamp.)  Get the point?  (His path is blocked by large swords sticking in the floor.  JAFAR grabs the lamp and laughs hideously. ALADDIN pulls a sword out of the floor.) I'm just getting warmed up!  (He breathes a ring of fire around ALADDIN.) ALADDIN:    Are you afraid to fight me yourself, you cowardly snake? JAFAR:  A snake, am I?  Perhaps you'd like to see how snake-like I can be!  (He smiles broadly, and we see a snake's tongue come out from behind his teeth.  He then turns into a giant cobra, and the ring of fire around ALADDIN becomes part of the snake encircling ALADDIN.  The snake JAFAR makes moves on ALADDIN, and on the third try, ALADDIN swings the sword and hits JAFAR.  Cut to GENIE cheerleaders wearing 'A' sweaters.) GENIE:  Rickem, rockem, rackem, rake--stick that sword into that snake! JAFAR:  You stay out of thissss! GENIE:  (Weakly) Jafar, Jafar, he's our man--if he can't do it, GREAT! (ALADDIN uses the distraction to make a break for the hourglass where JASMINE is trapped.  However, JAFAR sees this and blocks the path. ALADDIN is thrown away, and he loses his sword.) JASMINE:    Aladdin! (ALADDIN jumps on a large gem and slides across the floor, grabbing the sword on his way.  He turns a corner, but the pursuing snake cannot, and the front half of JAFAR crashes through a wall and hangs outside the palace.  ALADDIN jumps up on the snake's back and stabs it.  JAFAR screams in agony.  ALADDIN again tries to free the princess.) ALADDIN:    Hang on, Jasmine! JAFAR:  (laughs hideously)  You little fool!  You thought you could defeat the most powerful being on earth! IAGO:       (with GENIE coming up behind him) Squeeze him, Jafar--Squeeze him like a--awk! (GENIE elbows him out of the way) JAFAR:  Without the genie, boy, you're nothing! ALADDIN:    (Has an idea)  The genie!  The genie!  The genie has more power than you'll ever have! JAFAR:  What!! ALADDIN:    He gave you your power, he can take it away! GENIE:  Al, what are you doing?  Why are you bringing me into this? ALADDIN:    Face it, Jafar--you're still just second best! JAFAR:  You're right!  His power does exceed my own!  But not for long! GENIE:  The boy is crazy.  He's a little punch drunk.  One too many hits with the snake  (His hand turns into a snake and he hits his head with it.) JAFAR:  Slave, I make my third wish!  I wish to be an all powerful genie! GENIE:  (Reluctantly) All right, your wish is my command. Way to go, Al. (GENIE zaps JAFAR with the last GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt. JAFAR's snake form dissipates and he turns into a genie.  We see JASMINE's raised hand disappear under the sand.  ALADDIN runs over and finally smashes the glass.  Sand and princess pour out.) JAFAR:  Yes!  Yes!  The power! The absolute power! JASMINE:    (to ALADDIN) What have you done? ALADDIN:    Trust me! JAFAR:  The universe is mine to command, to control! ALADDIN:    Not so fast, Jafar!  Aren't you forgetting something? (JAFAR looks down questioningly) You wanted to be a genie, you got it!  And everything that goes with it! JAFAR:  No!  No! IAGO:       I'm gettin' out of here!  Come on, you're the genie, I don't want-- ALADDIN:    Phenomenal cosmic powers!  Itty bitty living space. GENIE:  Al, you little genius, you! (ABU turns back to normal, the CARPET re-ravels, JASMINE, the SULTAN and RAJAH are standing together.  RAJAH jumps up into the arms of the SULTAN, then they are all transformed.  The SULTAN is crushed because of the weight of the new RAJAH.  The palace reappears where it used to be in the city.  ALADDIN is left holding the new lamp.) JAFAR:  (Both from inside the lamp.)  Get your blasted beak out of my face! IAGO:       Oh, shut up, you moron! JAFAR:  Don't tell me to shut up! GENIE:  Allow me.  (He takes the lamp and goes to the balcony.  He is now wearing a baseball cap.  He winds up as if to throw the lamp, but opens his palm flat and flicks it out into the desert with his finger.) Ten- thousand years in a cave of wonders ought to chill him out! (JAFAR and IAGO continue to argue as they fade out.  JASMINE walks over to ALADDIN.  They hold hands, but both look sad.) ALADDIN:    Jasmine, I'm sorry I lied to you about being a prince. JASMINE:    I know why you did. ALADDIN:    Well, I guess...this... is goodbye?  (GENIE pokes his head around the corner shocked at what he is hearing.) JASMINE:    Oh, that stupid law.  This isn't fair--I love you. GENIE:  (Wipes away a tear)  Al, no problem. You've still got one wish left.  Just say the word and you're a prince again. ALADDIN:    But Genie, what about your freedom? GENIE:  Hey, it's only an eternity of servitude.  This is love.  (He leans down next to her.)  Al, you're not gonna find another girl like her in a million years.  Believe me, I know.  I've looked. ALADDIN:    Jasmine, I do love you, but I've got to stop pretending to be something I'm not. JASMINE:    I understand. (They take one final look into each other's eyes, then ALADDIN turns to the GENIE.) ALADDIN:    Genie, I wish for your freedom. GENIE:  One bona fide prince pedigree coming up.  I--what? ALADDIN:    (He holds the lamp up to GENIE.)  Genie, you're free! (A transformation scene ensues, in which the shackles fall off GENIE's wrist and the lamp falls uselessly to the ground. GENIE picks it up and looks at it.) GENIE:  (He can't believe it.)  Heh, heh!  I'm free. I'm free.  (He hands the lamp to ALADDIN.)  Quick, quick, wish for something outrageous.  Say  \"I want the Nile.\"   Wish for the Nile.  Try that! ALADDIN:    I wish for the Nile. GENIE:  No way!!  (Laughs hysterically.  He bounces around the balcony like a pinball.)  Oh does that feel good!  I'm free!  I'm free at last!  I'm hittin' the road.  I'm off to see the world!  I-- (He is packing a suitcase, but looks down and sees ALADDIN looking very sad.) ALADDIN:    Genie, I'm--I'm gonna miss you. GENIE:  Me too, Al.  No matter what anybody says, you'll always be a prince to me. SULTAN: That's right.  You've certainly proven your worth as far as I'm concerned. It's that law that's the problem. JASMINE:    Father? SULTAN: Well, am I sultan or am I sultan?  From this day forth, the princess shall marry whomever she deems worthy. JASMINE:    (She smiles widely and runs into ALADDIN's arms.) Him!  I choose...I choose you, Aladdin. ALADDIN:    Ha, ha.  Call me Al. (They are about to kiss when giant blue hands pull everybody together. GENIE is decked out in a Hawaiian shirt with golf clubs and a Goofy hat.) GENIE:  Oh, all of ya. Come over here.  Big group hug! Mind if I kiss the monkey?  (He kisses ABU.)  Ooh, hairball!  Well, I can't do any more damage around this popsicle stand.  I'm outta here!  Bye, bye, you two crazy lovebirds.  Hey, Rugman: ciao!  I'm history!   No, I'm mythology!  No, I don't care what I am--I'm free! (The GENIE flies up into the blue sky leaving a trail of sparkles behind him.  They cut (a jump cut to make matters worse) to fireworks exploding over a nightscape. We tilt down and see ALADDIN and JASMINE flying on CARPET.) ALADDIN:    A whole new world JASMINE:        A whole new life BOTH:   (with off-camera chorus)    For you and me! MEN'S CHORUS:   A whole new world! (They fly off into the moonlight, and after they have disappeared, the moon turns and reveals the GENIE's laughing face.  Suddenly the film is grabbed \"off the projector\", the GENIE lifts it up and looks at the audience.) GENIE:  Made ya look! (Drops the film back to normal, with the normal moon.  Fade to black. The end.)"}
